<p>I'm currently studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder as a candidate for a Bachelor's of Science in CS. I consider myself to be most proficient in Python and C++. I've also dabbled in a large variety of languages, including Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Lua, and some shell scripting where necessary.</p>
<p>My GitHub page is linked below. This includes some small projects, hackathons I've participated in, and the like. However, it's nowhere near representative of the majority of the code that I have written, nor is it representative of the sort of skills that I have; if you'd like for me to send you some better samples of what I'm capable of when coding, please <a href="/cv">contact me directly</a>.</p>
