title: About Me
---
<p>I'm currently studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder as a candidate for a Bachelor's of Science in CS. I consider myself to be most proficient in Python and C++. I've also dabbled in a large variety of languages, including Java, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML/CSS (if that even really counts), Lua, and some shell scripting where necessary.</p>
<p>If you'd like, you can check out my GitHub page, linked below, to see a more complete listing of things that I've done. This includes some silly small projects, hackathons I've participated in, and the like.</p>
