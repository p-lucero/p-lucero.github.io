<h2>
	About Me
</h2>
<p>
	I'm a software developer with a passion for quality code that helps people. I love developing algorithms that work, either provably or demonstrably, and making systems more performant. I'm concerned about social justice, especially the ways in which technology can contribute to systematic injustice and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>
	My strongest area of expertise is systems and backend software design, where I'm confident at any level ranging from Python programming down to x86-64 assembly. I've been wanting to learn more someday about the low-level workings of digital media (audio/video compression, DSP, high-performance data storage in this field) but have not found the opportunity and motivation to do so at this point.
</p>
<p>
	My most-practiced language is Python, which I use as a daily driver. I'm also pretty confident in C and its nearest derivatives, Java, Scala, and occasionally JavaScript if required.
</p>

<h2>
	My Credentials and Career
</h2>
<p>
	I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from CU Boulder's College of Engineering, as well as a Minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm an incoming member for the July cohort of Google's Engineering Residency program, where I will be working as a software developer. I'm currently located in Colorado, but hope to move out to Seattle once reality has stabilized a little bit.
