<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I'm a backend software engineer with a passion for simple, elegant,
	scalable solutions that radically simplify day-to-day tasks performed by
	everyone. I love designing systems built around explainable, auditable
	algorithms that take everyone's needs into account. I also love when I'm
	able to radically improve the performance of a system by making
	cross-cutting changes, or radically simplify a system by removing technical
	debt.
</p>
<p>
	I'm concerned about the ways in which technology fails to treat all
	individuals in an equitable fashion, particularly when it comes to
	applications involving machine learning. To that end, I work to ensure that
	any project I'm involved with is designed in an ethical and equitable
	fashion. I'm not interested in technology that perpetuates systematic
	injustices, exploits or reinforces inequitable conditions, or which chooses
	to solve a business problem at the expense of individuals' well-being.
</p>
<p>
	My strongest area of expertise is systems and backend software design,
	where I'm fluent at any level ranging from heavy-abstraction enterprise
	backends down to x86-64 assembly. Other topics I'd like to learn about
	include the low-level workings of digital media (audio/video compression,
	DSP, high-performance media storage) as well as programming language
	design and implementation.
</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>
	I've done significant work in a wide variety of languages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>C++ - my favored language for anything scalable</li>
	<li>C - used throughout undergraduate</li>
	<li>Java - currently my most-practiced language at my job</li>
	<li>Kotlin - currently learning on the side, finding very enjoyable</li>
	<li>Scala - learned in undergraduate</li>
	<li>
		Python - used for simple automations on my home computer that never
		need to scale beyond more than a handful of files
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Other languages I've used briefly or find less favorable:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		LaTeX - used for undergraduate note-taking and assignment type-setting,
		but I've probably forgotten most of the finer points
	</li>
	<li>Rust - viewed some tutorials, meaning to revisit eventually</li>
	<li>Groovy - built some pipelines</li>
	<li>JavaScript & web stack - not for me</li>
</ul>

<h2>Credentials and Career</h2>
<p>
	I'm currently working as a backend engineer at Google. I'm a small part of
	a very large team which maintains the storage and backend serving systems
	for Google user profile data and connections.
</p>
<p>
	Before that, I did a summer internship at Travelport, where I worked on an
	internal systems team to enable continuous integration capabilities for a
	complex monolithic hybrid-language Linux application used widely by
	Travelport's systems.
</p>
<p>
	In May 2020, I graduated summa cum laude from CU Boulder's College of
	Engineering with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, minoring in
	Applied Mathematics.
