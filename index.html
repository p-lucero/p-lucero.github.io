<p>I'm a student at CU Boulder, currently studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I'm interested in AI/ML, computer media (graphics/audio processing), network systems, and extremely performant code.</p>
<p>Most of my experience in writing code comes from a fairly strong background in Python, which I use as a coding language for most of my assignments at university, as well as a daily driver to automate small, boring tasks on my computer that I want to accomplish without having to direct it every step of the way. Typically, this is stuff like synchronizing my music library to devices other than my primary desktop (I'm very particular about this,) fixing Git history that I've broken, and simple tools like random number generation that I don't need fancy frontends for.</p>
<p>I'm also fairly strong in C and C++, and have used these to dabble a little bit in languages like Java and Scala.</p>
