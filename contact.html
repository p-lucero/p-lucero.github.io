<p>
	The best way to contact me is by email. Send a message to hi (at) the domain
	name of this website, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. You can
	also reach me on LinkedIn at
	<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/p-lucero/">linkedin.com/in/p-lucero</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you'd prefer to communicate by phone instead, please let me know via
	either email or LinkedIn first, and I'll send you my phone number. I don't
	answer calls from unsolicited numbers, as the vast majority of them turn
	out to be spam. Don't worry - I keep my other communication channels
	noise-free.
</p>

<p>
	Do not reach out to me about projects involving:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cryptocurrency, blockchain, NFTs, DeFi, web3, etc.</li>
	<li>Fintech, stock trading, etc.</li>
	<li>Full-stack or front-end development in web languages</li>
	<li>Transitioning to a career in business (MBA opportunities, etc.)</li>
	<li>Any project that does not help people do things (frequently opposed to:
		projects that help people make money, projects that help governments or
		corporations do things, projects that help governments or corporations
		make money)
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you do reach out about any of the above, you will not receive a response.
